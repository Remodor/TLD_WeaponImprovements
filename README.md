# Weapon Improvements for *The Long Dark*

This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

## Description

Guns aren't the biggest part of the game, but when you use them, they feel odd and unresponsive in some situations. E.g. Try unjamming a weapon after you clicked the jammed weapon. It will take a long second until the player even start the unjamming animation for no reason. Or try to fire a revolver after you reloaded it. I find myself spamming a button all the time because the buttons are not recognized. This mod is a really small **quality of live** mod which fixes some odd behaviors and adds useability. You can now interrupt a reload animation or hide the ammo hud.

## Settings

There are a few new settings in the *Mod Options*:

- Hide Ammo Hud

  *Does what it says. Lets you hide the ammo hud.*
- Cancel Reload

  *Press the reload button again during reloading and the player will insert the last bullet/ clip.*
- No Fire Delay After Reload

  *There is no more delay for firing a weapon after a reload.*
- No More Jame Delay

  *There is no more delay for unjamming a weapon after you tried to fire the jammed weapon.*
